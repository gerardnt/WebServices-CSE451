        This site is for an outdoor backyard game that I play when ever I have free time. The game is an outdoors 4 player game that is very similar 
        to volleyball. I played volleyball throughout high school and didn't have the time or commitment to play in college. This 
        game is portable and more convenient for me and my friends. There are 2 teams both with 2 players. Each team gets 3 hits or less 
        to hit the ball on the trampoline which signifies a change in possession. To hit up to 3 times you must hit to your teammate and they must
        hit the ball back to you. No double hits in a row for one person. If a team misses the net, hits the rim of the net, or hits the ball
        more than 3 times its the other teams point. You are not allowed to hit the ball more than once in a row, hit the rim with the ball, hit the ball 
        with two hands, or carry the ball. To win its the first team to 21 or 25. We usually do best of 3.

        This site is for a video game that I play whenever I have free time. Its called Rocket League and is basically soccer with 
        rocket powered cars. There are teams of up to 4 and everyone has and controls their own car. You just play soccer with a huge
        soccer ball that you try to score in the other goal by ramming the ball with your car. The website just includes links and information
        on the game and where/how to buy it.

        This site is the main social media that I go on to get my news. It allows members who register with the site to submit content that 
        is liked or disliked and based on the amount of likes it may appear on the front page. The site is made up of many different subsections called
        subreddits that is exactly like reddit but only for a specific topic. For example I go to "r/DunerMifflin" where all the posts relate to the 
        tv show the office. The site allows me to get the news I need to stay caught up in the world and the entertainment I need in between classes.
