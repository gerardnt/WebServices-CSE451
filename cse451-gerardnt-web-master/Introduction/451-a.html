   My Name is Nicholas Gerard I am a Junior Studying Software Engineering. I am From Cincinnati Ohio specifically the suburb of Loveland.
   I have a younger brother who is currently a freshman at Notre Dame. I have had 2 summer internships one at Mercy Health and the other at 
   Great American Insurance both as Software Engineers/Developers. This summer I will be up in Cleveland Ohio at Progressive Insurance as 
   an application developer. At Miami I am in Girls Who Code, Alpha Phi Omega, Tau Beta Pi as the Fundraising chair, and joining MUSTANG this semester.
   After Graduation I hope to move out west specifically somewhere near mountains because I love to camp.
