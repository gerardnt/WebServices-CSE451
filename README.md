# WebServices-CSE451
This Repository comes from my CSE 451/551 Web Services and Service Oriented Architecture class at Miami University. Some of the stuff we touched was
AWS specifically S3, API-Gateway, cloudwatch, Lambda, Alexa interactions, and EC2. We also dealt with PHP, HTML, CSS, Node js, JS, Jquery, Mysql, and other technologies, libraries, and frameworks.
